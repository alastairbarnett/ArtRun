The Master’s Voice ‘...trips up passers-by, induces double-takes, [and] private puzzled glances...' (Mitchell Whitelaw in Real Time Magazine #46, 2001).","The Meeting Place is made up of seven layered glass figures installed on a glass wall.","This whimsical artwork consists of a painted doll with a decorated carousel dog on either side, linking closely with the much loved Civic carousel.","The artist is renowned for a series of relief artworks redepicting illustrations from the ‘World Book of Knowledge'.","This monument represents the steps each person takes for peace. Bogong moths are shown being drawn to a flame by Ngunnawal artist Jim Williams. Bogong moths migrate through this area each year and were a traditional food source for local aboriginal people.","This work has recently been relocated to the refurbished foyer of the Canberra Theatre Centre. Thespis was the legendary originator of Greek tragedy.","The ACT Government commissioned Toku by Japanese artist Shinki Kato to celebrate the 1300th anniversary of Japan’s ancient capital, Nara.","Touching Lightly was funded in partnership by the ACT Government, ActewAGL and the ACTEW Corporation and the Land Development Agency.","This sculpture honours Australian writers and the part played by landscape in our literature. The streets of Garran are named after Australian writers and members of the Garran family. Local stone forms the base of this cast bronze sculpture which reflects playfully on relationships between human knowledge and our native landscape.","Twilight is an evocative and enigmatic public artwork that exists between sculpture, architecture, and landscape design. It evokes qualities of a memorial, monument and meeting place. Its form echoes the geometry and symbolism of Canberra's urban plan.","Two Legged Marsupial is one of two indoor public art sculptures by Geoffrey Bartlett located within the ACT Magistrates Court.","Two to Tango is two curvy linear metal forms that can be viewed as subtly referring to couples or plant shoots reflecting the growth and rise of the city centre and its changing demographic. The blue colour of the forms echo the blue skies of Canberra.","This lively mosaic provides a welcoming entry to the Family Health Centre.","Four large silhouettes are suspended above Koomari indoor pool: a person, a comet, a ring and a flower. The sculpture and its reflections create a unique experience for those that use the pool. The sculpture also works as a sound dampener in the pool area.","A series of highly-polished metal cubes appear to tumble across Margaret Timpson Park in the heart of the Belconnen Town Centre. This is one of three works by this celebrated Australian artist in Canberra: one work is permanently displayed in the Sculpture Garden at The National Gallery of Australia and another conceptual work is buried in the earth at Commonwealth Park.","This work by the renowned modernist artist Frank Hinder is one of the most subtle artworks in the city centre. Created as part of the building, the vaulted tiled ceiling is a remarkable blend of form, tone and colour. Monaro Mall established this precinct as a hub of retail activity in Civic from the early 1960s.","This ceramic wall mural depicts native Australian flora and fauna and stretches from the outside of the Perpetual Building into the foyer.","The original maquette for this work was designed and fabricated by Gerald Lewers, and developed and executed by Margo Lewers after his death. This 17 metre long sculpture includes a fulcrum and two weights symbolizing the Reserve Bank’s role in balancing the economy.","This untitled abstract artwork was donated to the ACT Public Art Collection by Leighton Properties.","Keiko Amenomori-Schmeisser's etched ink design adds texture to the outdoor projection screen in Garema Place.","This integrated work is screenprinted on the awnings of the city centre's bus platforms. Screenprinted footprints provide shade whilst representing the day to day pedestrian traffic in the area, reminding people of the many others who have passed through here before them.","This work is integrated with the building façade and was designed to complement the Commonwealth Bank building’s architecture.","The Vessel holds abstracted flowers that are illuminated at night and move with the breeze.","A pair of wind vanes in the shape of fish appear to swim through the air between the Tuggeranong Arts Centre and Lake Tuggeranong. One fish is cast black patinated aluminium, the other hollow form copper sheet with green patination. The work reflects life in the adjacent lake and plays on the nautical architecture of the Arts Centre building.","This artwork celebrates Dorothea Mackellar's popular Australian poem My Country which was written in 1908. The sculptural forms that make up the work are inspired by the cursive style of Mackellar's own hand-writing. The artwork frames a wide vista that stretches across the National Arboretum Canberra to the hills that mark Canberra's western and southern boundaries.","This work is a fine example of a style of kinetic sculpture popular through the late 1970’s. It marks the entry to 'the Boulevard' development which was anticipated to be an international retail precinct for Canberra. Whilst the Boulevard never fulfilled this promise, the first floor open air plaza is a fascinating example of 1970’s planning for public space.","This sculpture is the last public artwork of the well known artist, Peter Blizzard. His practice was unique in his use of contrasting materials as an ongoing investigation into the relationship of nature to the human spirit. He believed that we should venerate and respect what we have. This work is the artist’s response to the effect that grandeur, colour, light, texture and form within the natural landscape have on the wellbeing of the human spirit.","This sculpture combines materials that have very different visual and tactile qualities. The solidity and surface detail of natural granite is a sharp contrast to the ethereal, mirrored surface of stainless steel. Windstone brings a sensation of the material and immaterial together in one object. The artist's work has been described as an exploration of the experience of land and sky, and the concious and unconcious.","The memorial is dedicated to the memory of seven young people, including four children, who lost their lives in the Woden Floods on Australia Day 1971.","This bronze sculpture of a young eagle looks keenly down from its perch into the busy activity of Bunda Street. The sculpture evokes the strength, optimism and freedom of youth - a spirit that can be embraced at any age."};
